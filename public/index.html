    <p>
        Hello! I'm David Sampson a Sophmore computer Science Major at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology
    </p>
    <p>
        I've been programming since I was in 8th grade and I have a passion for finding coding solutions to problems I find myself having, one example of this is when I got annoyed with solving polynomials by hand so I decided to write a program that would be able to solve them for me.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I'm not coding I enjoy playing Dungeons and Dragons with my friends on the weekends.
